# CSIHO - Computer Security Incident Handling Ontology

CSIHO is **the first cybersecurity ontology focused on incident handling** and also the first to define and implement the fundamental concept of **security event** and to support recording the **temporal aspects of an incident**, enabling the creation of a timeline with all related occurrences.  It was developed as part of a master's dissertation, that will soon be available here: http://www.comp.ime.eb.br/pos/?l=0&p=26


### csiho_v1.0.0_20180405.owl
This is the original ontology developed for my master's dissertation, using Protégé 5.2.0. It includes example individuals inspired on a case study of an incident response of the WannaCry ransomware in a Fortune 500 company, as well as a couple of less detailed incidents included for experimentation purposes. Textual data is described in brazilian portuguese, but it will be translated to english in the next release.
